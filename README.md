# Technology-One-Technical-Test
Samuel Brown's submission for the Technology One Technical Test, issued on the 18th November by Mr. Tyler Sanders

I want to create the 'Numbers to Words' web app using C# and Microsoft's '.NET' web development framework.
I will use the Model View Controller web app layout to create this, and will try to abide by best coding practices.

Firstly, I created a private GitHub repository, and synced to my Visual Studio Code (as specified in the test task sheet)
Next, I created my index.html using Bootstrap for decoration (as I absolutely love bootstrap and both me and my dad have used it for almost 5 years)
Once the index.html looks good and is ready to be developed, I ran the following commands to make a new .NET web app:

dotnet new
dotnet new webapp
This created the files and folders necessary to make a standard Microsoft .NET web application (all default and requiring customisation)
Always have to check the application is running correctly by using dotnet run (all is fine)
Now I am integrating the existing index.html I made into the 'Pages' folder of my newly created .NET web app
